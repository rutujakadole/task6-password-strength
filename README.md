 Task 6 – Password Strength Evaluation Using Online Tool
- Objective

    The objective of this task is to understand password security, evaluate the strength of different passwords using an online password strength checker, 
    analyze weaknesses, and learn best practices for creating strong and secure passwords.

- Tool Used

    PasswordMonster – Online Password Strength Checker
     https://www.passwordmonster.com/

    PasswordMonster estimates how long it would take an attacker to crack a password using brute-force methods.

- Steps Performed

    Created multiple sample passwords with varying complexity levels
    
    Tested each password using PasswordMonster

- Observed:

    Time required to crack the password
    
    Password strength level
    
    Compared weak, medium, and strong passwords
    
    Researched common password attack techniques
    
    Documented best practices for strong password creation

- Password Strength Evaluation
    Password Type	    Estimated Crack Time	  Strength
    Simple password	   Instantly / Seconds	     Weak
    Moderate password	 Minutes / Hours	        Medium
    Complex password	 Years / Centuries	      Strong

    Screenshots of each test are included.

- Observations

    Short passwords are cracked instantly
    
    Passwords without symbols are weak
    
    Increasing password length greatly improves security
    
    Mixing uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols makes passwords stronger
    
    Predictable patterns reduce password strength

- Common Password Attacks:
     1. Brute Force Attack:
        An attack where all possible combinations are tried until the correct password is found.
        Long and complex passwords significantly reduce success.
     2. Dictionary Attack:
        Uses common words and leaked password lists to guess passwords.
        Avoid dictionary words and simple patterns.

- Best Practices for Strong Passwords

    Use 12–16 characters or more
    
    Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
    
    Avoid personal information
    
    Avoid reusing passwords
    
    Use a password manager
    
    Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)


- Safety Note

    All passwords used in this task were dummy test passwords created only for learning purposes. No real or personal passwords were tested.

- Conclusion

    This task improved my understanding of password strength, common password attacks, and best practices for creating secure passwords. 
    Using PasswordMonster helped visualize how password complexity directly affects resistance to attacks.
